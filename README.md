First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the original author of https://github.com/tanersb/TwitchRecover for their amazing work. This project is built upon their optimization.

Usage: 

1. As a first step, Download the zip file and unzip it, open command prompt at project directory root and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```to install required packages

2. Sign up at https://scrapingant.com/ and go to https://app.scrapingant.com/dashboard to copy your API key.

3. Open recover.py in the code editor, locate the variable api_key and replace the value with your API key 
   (e.g., api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"), then save the file.

        You can use the Twitch Tracker or Streams Charts link of a stream to directly get the VOD links.
